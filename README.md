# About
This is one of my first to automate some operations in my testing. The code itself is probably ugly but it does the job. I wrote Python script that allows me generate multiple PDF files and use them for manual and automated testing. I also wrote a short article on my blog.

Here are some things I learned:
- handling pdf files using Python modules pypdf2, reportlab
- yield operator
- pytest fixtures
- logging in Python
- using Git and GitHub
